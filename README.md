# eis_slot
Software for processing EIS slot data

This software was developed for a project to measure properties of the 40" slot of the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode spacecraft. The results will be published in Young & Ugarte-Urra (2022, in preparation).

The routine eis_fit_slot_exposure performs a 7-parameter fit to the slot emission in the X-direction for each Y-pixel along a single slot exposure.
